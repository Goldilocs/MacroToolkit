Excel Addin for automating excel based processes

I developed this addin for excel when I couldn't find an existing solution to a core need within our finance world: an addin which can be calibrated to automate steps within a file. At its core, the addin can be set up with specified parameters to:

* Pull in files, search for data from emails, download files from URLs
* Transform data
* Output results in files, draft or send emails with preset bodies, tables, and attachments

Additional features that need adding but I haven't successfully built or had time to explore:
* SQL data input
* Power point output
* Power point manipulation (eg. copy slide x from pack A to pack B)

Using the code requires a few standard sheets in the XLAM file (MACRO sheet for inputing action steps & Macro Parameters sheet with some key components). I'll upload these once I figure out how. 

I'm happy for suggestions and inputs to improve the quality of the code or add additional features.
